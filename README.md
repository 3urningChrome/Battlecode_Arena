Submit a competitor and have it fight every opponent on every map. 
Submissions can be anonymous, or you can proudly claim it as yours.

Once submitted anyone can run that competitor against any opponent on any map. 
or, if you wait long enough, auto generated games will play everyone against everyone else

TODO:
Competitors that have not battled for ?24hrs? (and not in top ?10?) will be deactivated, and will not be offered in drop downs for matches, however it will be possible to re-activate them should you so desire.
